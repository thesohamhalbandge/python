Here is a program which should ask for three utterances and print them out, like so:

The 1st part: hickory
The 2nd part: dickory
The 3rd part: dock
hickory-dickory-dock!
'''

# part = input("The 1st part: ")
# part = input("The 1st part: ")
# part = input("The 1st part: ")
# print(part + part + part)

part1 = input("The 1st part: ")
part2 = input("The 1st part: ")
part3 = input("The 1st part: ")
print(part1 + "-" + part2 + "-" + part3 + "!")
